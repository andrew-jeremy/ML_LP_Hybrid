# ML_LP_Hybrid
This repository contains the implementation of a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming (LP) into the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method provides a robust solution for solving complex optimization problems.
